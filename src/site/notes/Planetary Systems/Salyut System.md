The Salyut system is a currently uninhabited system that was originally home to the [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidragon\|Voidragon]], originally the planet [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Unsunyata - (Smallest Extinct Voidragon Homeworld)\|Unsunyata - (Smallest Extinct Voidragon Homeworld)]], and a few other mining planets. 

The system originally was full of activity, with the planet Unsunyata (one of the Voidragon Homeworlds) was the hub of all the interplanetary travel, and resource gathering. 

After [[Events/The Voidragon Collapse\|The Voidragon Collapse]], the system lays empty, with the 3 other resource planets [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Refineda (Resource Moon 1)\|Refineda (Resource Moon 1)]], and [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Forlorn (Resource Planet 3)\|Forlorn (Resource Planet 3)]] having their current mining operation halted (except for [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Utoma-tar (Resource Moon 2)\|Utoma-tar (Resource Moon 2)]], which has employed the use of robotic workers to continue mining to expand their working class).
