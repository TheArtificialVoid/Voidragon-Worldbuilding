There are 3 main terraforming towers located across the moon's surface.

The oldest is located within the [[Moon Locations/Western Gigantuem Forest\|Western Gigantuem Forest]], called [[Structures and Cities/Gigaterraformer\|Gigaterraformer]].
The most decayed in located within the [[Moon Locations/Neorifolian Forest\|Neorifolian Forest]], called [[Structures and Cities/Neoriterraformer\|Neoriterraformer]].
The youngest is located within the [[Moon Locations/Dryandrian Forest\|Dryandrian Forest]], called [[Structures and Cities/Dryaterraformer\|Dryaterraformer]].

All three towers are in a state of decay, with the surrounding forests very slowly shrinking back towards the pillars. Further study by [[Species and Civilsations/Psynovate Scientists\|Psynovate Scientists]] declared that the [[Structures and Cities/Ancient Terraformers\|Ancient Terraformers]] are in a broken state, only half terraforming the ancient moon. If left unmaintained for the next few hundred years, the biomes will fade and die off.
If fixed, the moon will be completely terraformed, allowing for life to fully flourish on the planet.

Some believe the [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidragon\|Voidragon]] species created these towers, although the technology seems to match mimic the [[Species and Civilsations/Walkerra\|Walkerra]] civilization, but [[Species and Civilsations/Psynovate Scientists\|Psynovate Scientists]] and [[Species and Civilsations/Startail Scientists\|Startail Scientists]] are unsure.
