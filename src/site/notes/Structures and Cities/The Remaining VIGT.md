The Remaining VIGT, or The planet of Wreckage, is the only known remaining VIGT left within the range of the [[Universe Locations/Grandway Galaxy\|Grandway Galaxy]]. Before [[Events/The Voidragon Collapse\|The Voidragon Collapse]], the [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidragon\|Voidragon]] used this VIGT to travel throughout [[Universe Locations/Deep Space\|Deep Space]] for points of interest, and as a space port for smaller spaceships. During one of its journeys through Deep Space, it collapsed as it collided with a large, newly opened varient of one of the [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidtexes\|Voidtexes]]. This collision forced the VIGT to collapse and shatter, leaving many of it's planet sized pieces scattered through out the edge of the galaxy.
