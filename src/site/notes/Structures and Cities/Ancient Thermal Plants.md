The Untundrian Ancient Thermal Plants are a series of mega-large scale thermal plants that harvest tectonic activity from the planet's insides, and release heat into the planet's atmosphere. This released heat allows for life on the planet to continue, and without it, the planet would quickly freeze over.

It is unknown who made The Ancient Thermal Plants, with some ties being lead to the [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidragon\|Voidragon]] species, or the [[Species and Civilsations/Walkerra\|Walkerra]] or even a different, unknown civilization. It is theorized that the creators of Ancient Thermal Plants also made the [[Structures and Cities/Ancient Terraformers\|Ancient Terraformers]] on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Regolanith\|Regolanith]].

There are 42 different thermal plants found throughout the planet. Although most thermal plants are in the same state, with most sharing the same size and same level of decay, there are a few different plants that have major changes from outside or inside forces.

Some Thermal Plants have been claimed by a ever-growing alien mold-like, called [[Plants and Animals/Xejo-Xero\|Xejo-Xero]]. With the mold itself starting to spread through the cave networks to other thermal plants.

Two Thermal Plants have been claimed by spontaneous [[Species and Civilsations/Untundrian Tribes\|Untundrian Tribes]].

Ten Thermals Plants have been claimed by [[Species and Civilsations/The Protectors of the Machine\|The Protectors of the Machine]].
