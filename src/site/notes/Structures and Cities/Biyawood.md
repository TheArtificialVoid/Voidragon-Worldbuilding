Biyawood is a large Neurionian settlement based on the north side of the [[Locations on Planets/The Rise\|The Rise]]. Famous for its location near [[Structures and Cities/Kaurino\|Kaurino]], tourists flock here throughout the [[Events/Alivell Season\|Alivell Season]] and late into the [[Events/Florun Season\|Florun Season]].

Leaves and sticks from [[Structures and Cities/Kaurino\|Kaurino]] rain down on the city periodically, usually during the [[Events/Alivell Season\|Alivell Season]]. Due to the healing, and lighting properties from the leaves fallen from the tree, many tourists gather in the city during the season, commencing the [[Events/Nerouian Light Festival\|Nerouian Light Festival]].

The City is named after the wood from the [[Plants and Animals/Libiyawood Tree\|Libiyawood Tree]], which was also used to make many of the houses in the suburbs of the city.
