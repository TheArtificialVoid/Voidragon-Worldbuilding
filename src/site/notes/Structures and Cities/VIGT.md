VIGT (or Voidragon Intergalactic Travelers) were exceedingly large spaceships that were constructed for intergalactic travel between the [[Universe Locations/Grandway Galaxy\|Grandway Galaxy]] and other galaxies through [[Universe Locations/Deep Space\|Deep Space]]. Although most ships are almost impossible to find due to the vast distances they travelled, one smaller VIGT, which collided with a large varient of one of the [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidtexes\|Voidtexes]], remains in a almost completely broken state orbiting the galaxy. This VIGT is called [[Structures and Cities/The Remaining VIGT\|The Remaining VIGT]].
