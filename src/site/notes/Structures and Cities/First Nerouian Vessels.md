The first Nerouian Vessels are a series of interplanetary spaceships that took two seperate cultural groups from [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Haloora\|Haloora]] and [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Oriana\|Oriana]], the [[Species and Civilsations/The Quo\|The Quo]] and [[Species and Civilsations/The Unait\|The Unait]], to [[Locations on Planets/The Rise\|The Rise]] on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Nerou\|Nerou]].

These Vessels were the first major set of ships designed for interplanetary travel, and are currently kept within museums within the township of [[Structures and Cities/Yourlarn\|Yourlarn]].
