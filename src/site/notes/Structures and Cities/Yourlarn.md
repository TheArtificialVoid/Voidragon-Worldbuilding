Yourlarn is the second largest city on the continent of [[Locations on Planets/The Rise\|The Rise]]. Famous for being the landing site of the [[Structures and Cities/First Nerouian Vessels\|First Nerouian Vessels]] to make planetfall on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Nerou\|Nerou]], The city was almost instantly formed after planetfall, making use of natural resources and brought technologies from the other planets.

Before planetfall on Nerou, smaller culturally different native groups from both [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Haloora\|Haloora]] and [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Oriana\|Oriana]] who ([[Species and Civilsations/The Quo\|The Quo]] and [[Species and Civilsations/The Unait\|The Unait]] respectively) were treated unfairly by other members of their own species. Before the two groups knew each other, the Quo was dealing with a war with a nearby country on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Haloora\|Haloora]], and the Unait was facing strategic political attacks and trade blocks from other nations on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Oriana\|Oriana]]. They both communicated through both different visits to each other's countries, and then both leaders organized and worked together to move their towns and peoples to [[Locations on Planets/The Rise\|The Rise]], which was only recently discovered by [[Species and Civilsations/Startail Scientists\|Startail Scientists]]. Due to how quickly they moved to Nerou, laying claim to [[Locations on Planets/The Rise\|The Rise]] to make sure the other planets were unable to make planetfall. This caused almost universal hate from other [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Haloora\|Haloora]] and [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Oriana\|Oriana]] peoples back on their home planets. 

The group then later renamed themselves to the Nerouian peoples, and both groups live in harmony while still respecting and practicing their own cultural practices. They still tell stories of their old homes, and the difficulties with space travel.
