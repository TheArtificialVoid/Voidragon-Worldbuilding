Startail Scientists are the [[Species and Civilsations/Startails\|Startails]]'s primary researchers, for anything relating to science, history, and space-travel.

Although responsible for the recent public research missions to other planetary systems for the Startail species, such as the recent missions to the [[Planetary Systems/Desmoor System\|Desmoor System]], Startail Scientists have been doing secret missions to other sections of the galaxy for nearly one hundred years.

One such mission was [[Events/Project Mucora\|Project Mucora]], a research and scouting mission for another home world, which ended in complete disaster.

Many top secret projects with the aid of [[Species and Civilsations/Psynovate Scientists\|Psynovate Scientists]] have been worked on since space-travel between planets was completed.
