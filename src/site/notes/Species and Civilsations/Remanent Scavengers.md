Remanent Scavengers are a large group of space travelling pillagers, whom raid moons or defenseless planets for resources, and ancient technology. 

It is unknown what happens to most of the technology they gather, with theories from [[Species and Civilsations/Psynovate Scientists\|Psynovate Scientists]] and some witnesses ranging from use in smelting down for resources, or selling to far-off worlds inside [[Universe Locations/Deep Space\|Deep Space]].
