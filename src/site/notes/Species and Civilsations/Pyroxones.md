'Pyro-zones'

Pyroxones are the dominating species on the southern hemisphere of [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Mantle\|Mantle]]. 

After being in a constant war with the [[Species and Civilsations/Thornarites\|Thornarites]] for thousands of years, due to biological, cultural, and religious differences, the multi-generational war has been put on hold due to lack of resources on both sides. 

The war is referred to as [[Events/The Glass War\|The Glass War]] due to how fragile previous peace treaties were.
