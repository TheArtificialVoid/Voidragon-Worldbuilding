Startails are a sentient spacefaring civilisation that inhabit the world [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Oriana\|Oriana]] and the island of [[Locations on Planets/The Rise\|The Rise]] on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Nerou\|Nerou]].

Startails have long necks and tails, characterised by the bioluminescent spots that line them. These spots allow for complex communication and for courtship rituals.  Four appendages protrude from their necks, that are used for feeding, and for reaching. 2 large clawed hands allow them to create anything, including art which is a well adored pastime of many of the species. Large dragon-like heads allow for large brains, helping with their creative abilities. Startails are Digitigrades, walking on 4 large toe like appendages.

Although an ancient species, they have only recently discovered interspace travel, and many of the industrial groups, the [[Species and Civilsations/Startail Scientists\|Startail Scientists]] have been working towards exploring the universe. They have currently explored through the whole [[Planetary Systems/Quilifen System\|Quilifen System]], inhabiting planets like [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Nerou\|Nerou]], [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Haloora\|Haloora]] and even settling small research bases on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Untundria\|Untundria]] 

Although starting on interplanetary research, they have begun to working to get toward the nearest system, the [[Planetary Systems/Desmoor System\|Desmoor System]].
