'Thorn-nare-rites' 

Thornarites are the dominating species for the northern hemisphere on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Mantle\|Mantle]].

After being in a constant war with the [[Species and Civilsations/Pyroxones\|Pyroxones]] for thousands of years, due to biological, cultural, and religious differences, the multi-generational war has been put on hold due to lack of resources on both sides.

The war is referred to as [[Events/The Glass War\|The Glass War]] due to how fragile previous peace treaties were.
