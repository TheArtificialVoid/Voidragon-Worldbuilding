The Protectors of the Machine are a religious civilization of native [[Species and Civilsations/Untundrian Tribes\|Untundrian Tribes]] whom live on the planet [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Untundria\|Untundria]].

These protectors spend live within the thermal plants, protecting it from [[Species and Civilsations/Remanent Scavengers\|Remanent Scavengers]], and repairing the damages that the plants sustain from many, many years of operating. Although they do not understand completely how the machines work, they use technology gathered from the plants that allow them to salvage damages.

Using an ancient form of welding to fix the thermal plants, the civilization has established a hierarchy based on skill, with the most advanced repairmen honing different skills and trades compared to the common Untundrian.

Many POTMs have been known to travel to far off worlds with space-crews to help repair spaceships with off-world training, although many come home after 10-20 years in space. One much older, much smarter POTM, [[Unique People/Eltlin The Warrior\|Eltlin The Warrior]] is currently residing on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Regolanith\|Regolanith]], slowly repairing the [[Structures and Cities/Ancient Terraformers\|Ancient Terraformers]] on the moon's surface. He has been on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Regolanith\|Regolanith]] for 40 years, and has made the different [[Structures and Cities/Ancient Terraformers\|Ancient Terraformers]] his territory.
