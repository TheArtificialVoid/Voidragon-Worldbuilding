The Greater Yearnara Depths is the largest biome on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Nerou\|Nerou]], being home to some of the largest sea dwelling life in the [[Planetary Systems/Quilifen System\|Quilifen System]]. Although a vast biome, it mostly consists of deep waters, and an almost barren sea floor (outside of rock features, and some smaller coral structures).
