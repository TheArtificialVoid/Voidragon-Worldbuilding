The Phreatol Ocean is the largest ocean on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Mantle\|Mantle]]. Although large in size, just like its smaller counterpart, the [[Planet Ocean Locations/Magnoian Ocean\|Magnoian Ocean]], are biodiverse with lava-based life, and a battleground between the two civilizations of [[Species and Civilsations/Thornarites\|Thornarites]] and the [[Species and Civilsations/Pyroxones\|Pyroxones]].

Unlike it's smaller counterpart however, the Phreatol ocean is deeper, and connects to the [[Planet Ocean Locations/Basalt Sea\|Basalt Sea]], allowing for more diverse life, and even lavafishing communities to form.
