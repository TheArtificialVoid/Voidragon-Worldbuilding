The Aumornian Coral Fields is a much more shallow biome within the [[Planet Ocean Locations/Yearnara\|Yearnara]] ocean, found mostly around the equator of [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Nerou\|Nerou]].

Teeming with life, giant coral structures line the seafloor allowing many of the native life to hide from larger predators lurking within the shallow waters.
