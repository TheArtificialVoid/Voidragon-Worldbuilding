Unsunyata was one of the homeworlds of the [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidragon\|Voidragon]] before [[Events/The Voidragon Collapse\|The Voidragon Collapse]].

The planet is currently destroyed, but evidence of the planet being in its orbit show in the other orbits of [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Refineda (Resource Moon 1)\|Refineda (Resource Moon 1)]], [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Utoma-tar (Resource Moon 2)\|Utoma-tar (Resource Moon 2)]], and [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Forlorn (Resource Planet 3)\|Forlorn (Resource Planet 3)]]. Some ancient technology is still found orbiting where the planet once was. 

Not much is known about this planet, outside of being the home of The [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidragon\|Voidragon]], [[Unique People/Aria (The Last Voidragon)\|Aria (The Last Voidragon)]] and the species of[[Plants and Animals/The Six-Sided Flower\|The Six-Sided Flower]].
