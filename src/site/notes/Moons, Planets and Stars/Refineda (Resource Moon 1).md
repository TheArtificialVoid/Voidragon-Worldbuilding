Refineda is one of the Resource Moons that resides in the [[Planetary Systems/Salyut System\|Salyut System]]. 

Other moons in the system include [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Utoma-tar (Resource Moon 2)\|Utoma-tar (Resource Moon 2)]], and [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Forlorn (Resource Planet 3)\|Forlorn (Resource Planet 3)]].

Originally operated and mined out by the [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidragon\|Voidragon]] before [[Events/The Voidragon Collapse\|The Voidragon Collapse]], the moon is left completely empty outside of the leftover mining equipment, and the very few automated mining robots that continue to mine out the moon's interior.
