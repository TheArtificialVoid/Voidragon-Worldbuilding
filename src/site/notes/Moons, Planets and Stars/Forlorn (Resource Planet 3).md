Forlorn is the most distant resource moon in the [[Planetary Systems/Salyut System\|Salyut System]].

Other moons in the system include [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Refineda (Resource Moon 1)\|Refineda (Resource Moon 1)]], and [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Utoma-tar (Resource Moon 2)\|Utoma-tar (Resource Moon 2)]].

The moon is covered in ice and snow, and most of the mining equipment was taken from the planet by [[Species and Civilsations/Remanent Scavengers\|Remanent Scavengers]], leaving scrap and a barren wasteland in its waste. With the moon left in isolation for all of these years, it has become the dumping ground for waste and scrap for many spacefaring travelers.
