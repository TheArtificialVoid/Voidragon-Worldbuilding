Untundria is the furthest planet from the sun [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Ingi\|Ingi]] of the Quilifen System, located completely outside of the habitable zone of the system. 

Life is sparse but is kept alive by [[Structures and Cities/Ancient Thermal Plants\|Ancient Thermal Plants]] all over the planet that keeps the world from freezing over, although the thermal plants are incredibly aged and are beginning to fail.
