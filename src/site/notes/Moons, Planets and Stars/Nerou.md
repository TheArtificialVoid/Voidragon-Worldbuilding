Nerou orbits its parent star [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Ingi\|Ingi]].

Nerou is a mostly ocean planet dominated by large sea monsters, that roam its large ocean called [[Planet Ocean Locations/Yearnara\|Yearnara]]. 

One large island, called [[Locations on Planets/The Rise\|The Rise]] stems out of the ocean that hosts a small population of terrestrial animals and peoples. Although no native civilization lives on the island, a large group of indiviuals from both [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Oriana\|Oriana]], and [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Haloora\|Haloora]] moved onto the island a long time ago to both create settlements, and to farm the native land and sea animals. These people have formed their own community, and have become the [[Species and Civilsations/Nerouian People\|Nerouian People]].

Due to the danger of the oceans, there is no Ancient-based technology within it's waters.
