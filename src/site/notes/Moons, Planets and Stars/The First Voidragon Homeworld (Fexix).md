Not much is known about the first [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidragon\|Voidragon]] Homeworld.

The [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidragon\|Voidragon]] originated from there, and it was destroyed during [[Events/The Voidragon Collapse\|The Voidragon Collapse]].

It's location was halfway through the [[Universe Locations/Grandway Galaxy\|Grandway Galaxy]] in the [[Planetary Systems/Forgomox System\|Forgomox System]]. The system still holds many artefacts from the planet on other moons and planet in the system.
