Zeromos is the supermassive blackhole within the center of the [[Universe Locations/Grandway Galaxy\|Grandway Galaxy]], that has most of the galaxy orbit around it. Although inaccessible, one [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidragon\|Voidragon]] homeworld, [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Nullarquall - (Galaxy Center's Voidragon Homeworld)\|Nullarquall - (Galaxy Center's Voidragon Homeworld)]] fell into the blackhole during [[Events/The Voidragon Collapse\|The Voidragon Collapse]]. 

Little is known about the lost homeworld, and of the interior of the blackhole due to it's nature. Although rumors say of very few individuals who enter and leave the blackhole as they please, and that the [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Nullarquall - (Galaxy Center's Voidragon Homeworld)\|Nullarquall - (Galaxy Center's Voidragon Homeworld)]] is still intact.
