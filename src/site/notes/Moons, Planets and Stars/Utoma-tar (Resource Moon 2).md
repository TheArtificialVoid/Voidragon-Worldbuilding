Utoma-tar is one of the [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidragon\|Voidragon]] Resource Moons found in the [[Planetary Systems/Salyut System\|Salyut System]].

Other moons in the system include [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Refineda (Resource Moon 1)\|Refineda (Resource Moon 1)]], and [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Forlorn (Resource Planet 3)\|Forlorn (Resource Planet 3)]].

The moon is unable to be studied due to the amount of robots and sentient automata defending the moon at all times. These robots have been observed creating their own rituals and culture, creating cityscapes and engineering their own environments.

Contact with the robots has all failed, and most other civilizations warn not to near the moon in fear of being shot out of orbit, or atomized.
