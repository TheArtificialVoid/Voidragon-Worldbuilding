Mantle is the closet planet to its sun [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Ingi\|Ingi]], mostly covered in lava oceans, lava lakes and few sparse areas of life directly arounds the poles of the planet.

This place is almost unhabitable for most other life in the system. Most native life is found in the polar regions, and on few islands that dot its lava oceans. Ancient mining technology is found commonly around throughout the lava lakes, with small pockets of life residing on large ancient resource gathering machines throughout the tropics of the planet.

The planet itself has two main areas of life within the polar regions, with the south pole [[Locations on Planets/Pyroxena\|Pyroxena]], and the north pole [[Locations on Planets/Ametrice\|Ametrice]] hosting 2 separate civilizations (The [[Species and Civilsations/Pyroxones\|Pyroxones]] and The [[Species and Civilsations/Thornarites\|Thornarites]]). The planet features two main lava oceans, [[Planet Ocean Locations/Phreatol Ocean\|Phreatol Ocean]], and [[Planet Ocean Locations/Magnoian Ocean\|Magnoian Ocean]], with two smaller seas, being the [[Planet Ocean Locations/Basalt Sea\|Basalt Sea]] (surrounding the [[Locations on Planets/Basalt Islands\|Basalt Islands]]) and the [[Planet Ocean Locations/Cindersalt Sea\|Cindersalt Sea]]. 

The connecting straight between the two continents, called the [[Locations on Planets/Fractured Straight\|Fractured Straight]] is prone to conflict, and is the front line for [[Events/The Glass War\|The Glass War]].
