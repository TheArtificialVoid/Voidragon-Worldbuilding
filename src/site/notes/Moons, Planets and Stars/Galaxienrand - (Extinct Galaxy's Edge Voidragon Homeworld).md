Galaxienrand was the furthest Voidragon homeworld in the [[Universe Locations/Grandway Galaxy\|Grandway Galaxy]], found in the [[Planetary Systems/Losta System\|Losta System]] it was used as a gateway into [[Universe Locations/Deep Space\|Deep Space]], allowing large intergalactic space ships to be constructed and used. Although many different [[Structures and Cities/VIGT\|VIGT]] Ships were constructed and used, many are unable to be found due to the distance they travelled, and how fast they were in [[Universe Locations/Deep Space\|Deep Space]].
