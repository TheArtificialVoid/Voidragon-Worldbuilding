Nullarquall was one of the Voidragon Homeworlds that was based near the centre of the galaxy. Although the planet's remains have collapsed into the blackhole in the center of the [[Universe Locations/Grandway Galaxy\|Grandway Galaxy]], called [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Zeromos\|Zeromos]]. Although no remains of Nullarquall remain, [[Species and Civilsations/Psynovate Scientists\|Psynovate Scientists]] theorise the homeworld was used to study the blackhole, and as an outpost for the centre region of the galaxy.
