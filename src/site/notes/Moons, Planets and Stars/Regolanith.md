Regolanith (Regolith + Land) is a moon orbiting the planet [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Haloora\|Haloora]], featuring a variety of different ecological biomes surrounding 3 ancient structures. Originally a desolate moon, three [[Structures and Cities/Ancient Terraformers\|Ancient Terraformers]] landed and embedded themselves into the moon thousands of years ago, changing a large amount of the terrain into habitable forests and lakes. Although the areas outside of the terraformed lands inhabitable, lacking any sort of life, all areas within the terraformed radius act like the conditions found within the temperate areas of Oriana.

One of the interdimensional Portals to [[Dimensional Stuff/The Othergarden\|The Othergarden]] is found here, residing within the cave called [[Moon Locations/Canvas Cavern\|Canvas Cavern]].
