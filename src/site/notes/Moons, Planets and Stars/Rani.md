Rani is a moon orbiting the planet [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Oriana\|Oriana]]. Famous for its [[Moon Locations/Glass Desert\|Glass Desert]] that reflects the light from [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Ingi\|Ingi]] directly towards [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Oriana\|Oriana]].

Rani is much smaller than [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Regolanith\|Regolanith]], but does share some similar features. Both moons share [[Structures and Cities/Ancient Terraformers\|Ancient Terraformers]], although only a single [[Moon Locations/Broken Terraformer\|Broken Terraformer]] remains on Rani, and it has completely shattered due to the [[Events/Xerk-xee Nuclear Tests\|Xerk-xee Nuclear Tests]] done a few hundred years ago.

Three Rani moon bases are located on the fair side of the moon, opposite of the [[Moon Locations/Glass Desert\|Glass Desert]] called the [[Moon Locations/Submerged Sister Rani Bases\|Submerged Sister Rani Bases]]. Originally designed for scientific tests and for early rocket launches before the invention of the [[Oorm Phase Launcher\|Oorm Phase Launcher]].
