The 'Final Filter of Corpa'aqku from the depths of Lormaniant' (The Corp for short), is a filter dimension for those who fall out of [[Dimensional Stuff/The Starzone\|The Starzone]], and [[Dimensional Stuff/The Othergarden\|The Othergarden]], mainly through the process of death. [[Dimensional Stuff/The Abyss\|The Abyss]] was considered for the same treatment but was unable to be combatable due to some issues reguarding the nature of the dimension.

The only person aware of this dimension from the Starzone is [[Unique People/Aria (The Last Voidragon)\|Aria (The Last Voidragon)]].
