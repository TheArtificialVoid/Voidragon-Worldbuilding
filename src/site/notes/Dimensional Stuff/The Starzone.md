This dimension is most similar to ours, and is where the [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidragon\|Voidragon]] Civilization arose. 

Although there are millions of different galaxies through The Starzone, The [[Universe Locations/Grandway Galaxy\|Grandway Galaxy]], once the home of the [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidragon\|Voidragon]], is where most of the stories within [[Dimensional Stuff/The Universe of the Voidragons\|The Universe of the Voidragons]] take place.

The space between galaxies within this dimension is called [[Universe Locations/Deep Space\|Deep Space]], and is an empty area of space that separates the galaxies from one another. There are many different artifacts from other galaxies within Deep Space, such as [[Dimensional Stuff/The Forgotten Gateway\|The Forgotten Gateway]], or the [[Structures and Cities/The Remaining VIGT\|The Remaining VIGT]].
