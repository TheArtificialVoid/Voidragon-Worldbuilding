This dimension is most similar to ours, and is where the Voidragon Civilization arose. 

There are many, many different galaxies within this dimension, but the main one, The [[Universe Locations/Grandway Galaxy\|Grandway Galaxy]] is where most of this dimension's story takes place.

The space between galaxies within this dimension is called [[Universe Locations/Deep Space\|Deep Space]], and is an empty area of space that separates the galaxies from one another.
