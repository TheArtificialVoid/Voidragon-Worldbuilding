Four main dimensions take place within this universe.

[[Dimensional Stuff/The Starzone\|The Starzone]] is the most populated dimension, similar to ours. Stars, planets, and moons dot the empty void, bound by gravity and space-time.

[[Dimensional Stuff/The Othergarden\|The Othergarden]] is an endless garden-scape that hosts all plant, and fungus-like life from all dimensions. An artificial dimension made by an ancient force.

[[Dimensional Stuff/The Abyss\|The Abyss]] is a empty void-like dimension found within all black holes within the universe. Consider every blackhole as a one-way gateway to this dimension.

[[Dimensional Stuff/The Corpa'aqku\|The Corpa'aqku]] is considered as a soul filter within the universe. Capturing lost souls that fall too far from the veil of reality.
