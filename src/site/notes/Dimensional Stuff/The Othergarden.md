The Othergarden is a mysterious, infinitely massive Garden-like dimension, that hosts flora found across the universe.

Artificial Structures, such as pathways, garden decoration, pillars allow for easy access across the plane, and some structures such as recent developments such as [[Structures and Cities/Abandoned campsites\|Abandoned campsites]] found throughout the garden were created by early explorers trying to map the dimension.

Due to a strange phenomenon regarding sleeping within the Othergarden, called [[Effects and Conditions/Gardensomnia\|Gardensomnia]], sleeping is impossible within the dimension. Recent explorers however continue to set up campsites to try rest and take inventory on the supplies both gathered and remaining from exploration. 

Mapping the dimension has proven to be difficult, due to structures, such as portals shifting from their known locations to further, more distant areas, causing many early mapping expeditions to fail, and explorers to be lost.

The Othergarden is made from multiple different sections that allow it to be easily documented. The [[Species and Civilsations/Startails\|Startails]] Gardeneer [[Unique People/Lamnia Corep\|Lamnia Corep]] discovered that sections of The Othergarden are separated by both climate, and wherever in [[Dimensional Stuff/The Starzone\|The Starzone]] plants come from, either that being a planet, moon or other celestial body.

Although it is a separate dimension, only a few known portals in and out are accessible. Two known portals within the [[Planetary Systems/Quilifen System\|Quilifen System]], one within the deepest sections of [[Moon Locations/Canvas Cavern\|Canvas Cavern]] on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Regolanith\|Regolanith]], and the other somewhere on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Rani\|Rani]]. A few other known portals have been found around the galaxy, and possibly many more around the universe.

Some theories surrounding the garden suggest it is used to help cease extinction of plants and fungi throughout the universe, as a 'Garden of Eden' of sorts. It is unknown how the Othergarden came to be.
