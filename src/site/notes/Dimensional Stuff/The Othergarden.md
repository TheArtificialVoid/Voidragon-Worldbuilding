The Othergarden is a mysterious, infinitely massive Garden-like dimension, that hosts flora found across the universe. 

The Garden mirrors the [[Dimensional Stuff/The Starzone\|The Starzone]], with each planet and moon's flora taking up their own well defined area. Each individual sections of the garden are called a [[The Othergarden/Lifen section\|Lifen section]], with each Lifen section having a varied climate depending on the climate of the planet/moon in [[Dimensional Stuff/The Starzone\|The Starzone]]. Each Lifen Section are bundled together into a [[The Othergarden/Macrosystem section\|Macrosystem section]], which usually are named after the planetary system that the different Lifen sections are based from.

Artificial Structures, such as pathways, garden decoration, pillars allow for easy access across the plane, and some structures such as recent developments such as [[Structures and Cities/Abandoned campsites\|Abandoned campsites]] found throughout the garden, created by early explorers mapping the dimension. The Dimension has been getting harder and harder to map, with distant areas from the [[The Othergarden/Quilifen section\|Quilifen section]] having dangerous/toxic flora throughout.

Due to a strange phenomenon regarding sleeping within the Othergarden, called [[Effects and Conditions/Gardensomnia\|Gardensomnia]], sleeping is impossible within the dimension. Recent explorers however continue to set up campsites to try rest and take inventory on the supplies both gathered and remaining from exploration. 

The Othergarden is made from multiple different sections that allow it to be easily documented. The [[Species and Civilsations/Startails\|Startails]] Gardeneer [[Unique People/Lamnia Corep\|Lamnia Corep]] discovered that sections of The Othergarden are separated by both climate, and wherever in [[Dimensional Stuff/The Starzone\|The Starzone]] plants come from, either that being a planet, moon or other celestial body.

Although it is a separate dimension, only a few known portals in and out are accessible. Two known portals within the [[Planetary Systems/Quilifen System\|Quilifen System]], one within the deepest sections of [[Moon Locations/Canvas Cavern\|Canvas Cavern]] on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Regolanith\|Regolanith]], and the other somewhere on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Rani\|Rani]]. A few other known portals have been found around the galaxy, and possibly many more around the universe.

Some theories surrounding the garden suggest it is used to help cease extinction of plants and fungi throughout the universe, as a 'Garden of Eden' of sorts. It is unknown how the Othergarden came to be.
