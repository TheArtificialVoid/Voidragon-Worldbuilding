The forgotten Gateway is an ancient asteroid in [[Universe Locations/Deep Space\|Deep Space]] that hosts one of the portals to [[Dimensional Stuff/The Othergarden\|The Othergarden]]. Although the Gateway is inaccessible from the outside by most means, there are very few who have discovered it through travelling through gardens, documenting the location of the portal, and where it resides in deep space.

One explorer mapped out the stars outside of the portal, and discovered the portal is located within the void of two separate galaxies, neither being nearby [Gateway Galaxy].

Some ancient technology was found attached to the asteroid, but records do not declare if they were retrieved.
