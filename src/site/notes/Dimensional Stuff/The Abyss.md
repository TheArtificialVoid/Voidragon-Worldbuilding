The Abyss is a endless void, and acts like the stomach of black holes, although a separate dimension, it is hard to document due to the lack of features within it, and how it is nearly impossible to leave.

Sections of planets and torn apart spaceships are found here if torn apart by any black hole. Planets such as [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Nullarquall - (Galaxy Center's Voidragon Homeworld)\|Nullarquall - (Galaxy Center's Voidragon Homeworld)]] and many other planets, moons, suns or other objects are found here.
