The Xerk-xee Nuclear Tests (or XXNT) were some of the largest nuclear tests ever carried out in the [[Planetary Systems/Quilifen System\|Quilifen System]]. Four bombs were tested on the surface of [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Rani\|Rani]], to experiment with nuclear weapons in space, and how the surface of Rani reacts with larger nuclear bombs.

During the testing of the bombs, [[Structures and Cities/Starship Fermi\|Starship Fermi]] carried 4 separate nuclear bombs within its hull. The names of the bombs were as follows; Landgro, Morningstar, Brapolo Minor, and Brapolo Major. 

Progression;
Landgro was dropped first, detonating away from [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Rani\|Rani]] in space.
Morningstar was dropped 2 hours after, 500m above the surface of Rani.
Brapolo Minor was dropped 6 hours later, being the second largest bomb, detonating around 40~ meters from the ground.
Brapolo Major was dropped 45 hours later, while members aboard the [[Structures and Cities/Starship Fermi\|Starship Fermi]] fled back to [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Oriana\|Oriana]].

Damages;
Landgro - Although detonated in space, the flash did blind one of the engineers aboard the [[Structures and Cities/Starship Fermi\|Starship Fermi]].
Morningstar - Scorched a portion of the surface underneath.
Brapolo Minor - turned a small portion of the moon to glass, also causing the first crater.
Brapolo Major - The explosion was so large that it transformed the rest of the [[Moon Locations/Glass Desert\|Glass Desert]] to glass, remelting the glass caused by Brapolo Minor. Brapolo Major also blew up the [[Moon Locations/Broken Terraformer\|Broken Terraformer]] collapsing the tower in seconds.

The Nuclear test was named after the [[Unique People/Brapolo Brothers\|Brapolo Brothers]], Xerk Brapolo and Xee Brapolo, the [[Species and Civilsations/Startails\|Startails]] inventors of the Nuclear bomb.
