The Voidragon Collapse is the name given to the event of the [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidragon\|Voidragon]] extinction.

During the collapse, many different events occurred that caused the Voidragon species to fall into almost complete extinction. One of the major events is the involves the [[Voidragon Stuff/Lost Voidragon Homeworlds\|Lost Voidragon Homeworlds]]. 

One such event is one of the [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Nullarquall - (Galaxy Center's Voidragon Homeworld)\|Nullarquall - (Galaxy Center's Voidragon Homeworld)]] falling into [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Zeromos\|Zeromos]], the largest known blackhole within the [[Universe Locations/Grandway Galaxy\|Grandway Galaxy]].  Another is the disappearance of the planets [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Unsunyata - (Smallest Extinct Voidragon Homeworld)\|Unsunyata - (Smallest Extinct Voidragon Homeworld)]], [[Moons, Planets and Stars/The First Voidragon Homeworld (Fexix)\|The First Voidragon Homeworld (Fexix)]], and [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Galaxienrand - (Extinct Galaxy's Edge Voidragon Homeworld)\|Galaxienrand - (Extinct Galaxy's Edge Voidragon Homeworld)]]. 

Although the reason for the disappearance of these planets is mostly unknown, eye witnesses have told stories, or documented the disaster as directly caused by an ancient force, being either a rogue god, or a wave of external disasters, such as plagues, warfare, or other civilization ending forces.
