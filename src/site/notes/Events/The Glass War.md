The Glass War is a war on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Mantle\|Mantle]] that has lasted for thousands of years, although currently on hold due to lack of resources on both sides. It was named after how fragile previous treaties were in the past.

Due to the danger of consistent warfare, many [[Species and Civilsations/Thornarites\|Thornarites]] and [[Species and Civilsations/Pyroxones\|Pyroxones]] have left their home world, and have settled in different areas throughout the galaxy. Many individuals have moved to closer planets, such as the ones within the [[Planetary Systems/Quilifen System\|Quilifen System]], with growing populations on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Haloora\|Haloora]] and [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Oriana\|Oriana]].

The war started by the [[Species and Civilsations/Thornarites\|Thornarites]], after taking territory within the [[Locations on Planets/Fractured Straight\|Fractured Straight]] from the [[Species and Civilsations/Pyroxones\|Pyroxones]], bombing and demolishing many of their towns and cities located throughout the straight. The [[Species and Civilsations/Pyroxones\|Pyroxones]] responded by bombing many of the [[Structures and Cities/Ametrician Docks\|Ametrician Docks]] on the northern [[Planet Ocean Locations/Phreatol Ocean\|Phreatol Ocean]], and [[Planet Ocean Locations/Magnoian Ocean\|Magnoian Ocean]]. Although just the start of the war, many different events have occurred over the course of history that many war crimes have become undocumented over the course of history.

Although the war is still on pause, the government on both sides have chosen not to interact with one another either through trade, or through communication, although few have decided to ignore these rules and interact with one another anyway.
