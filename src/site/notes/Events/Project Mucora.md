Project Murcora was a research project which sent five [[Species and Civilsations/Startail Scientists\|Startail Scientists]] on a small intersystem Vessel called [[Structures and Cities/Mucora I\|Mucora I]] to the planet [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Mucora\|Mucora]] within the [[Planetary Systems/Mykesian System\|Mykesian System]].

During the trip, many issues with the travel time, the ships hardware, and resources began to cause the crewmembers issues. After a travel time of 5 years and 194 days, the crew arrived into the [[Planetary Systems/Mykesian System\|Mykesian System]] to carry out the investigation of the planets, although with limited food and resources.

After finding [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Mucora\|Mucora]], the planet habitable enough to become another world for the [[Species and Civilsations/Startails\|Startails]], they landed on the planet to research the environment for further habitability. Harvesting raw resources, for the trip home, they spent two weeks on the planet, finding a nourishing source of food. After finding and consuming the now known young clusters of [[Plants and Animals/Xejo-Xero\|Xejo-Xero]]s, the group began to show signs of psychosocial health defects after leaving the planet.

Unfortunately, after living on the surface of [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Mucora\|Mucora]] for multiple weeks during a major sporing event, the team began to suffer major health defects, so they left earlier than requested. After leaving the planet with the research samples, the team began to document many problems with their general wellbeing, including physical and mental health. 

Previous ship recordings recovered during the ship's return to the [[Planetary Systems/Quilifen System\|Quilifen System]] show dangerous states of insanity, with previously unrecorded behavior with crew members. On collection of the data gathered from visiting the system, and the crew's suffering, the few [[Species and Civilsations/Startail Scientists\|Startail Scientists]] monitoring the mission decided to not bring them home, disposing of the samples and the evidence by crashing them into [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Ingi\|Ingi]] to make sure they were not bringing a potentially world-ending lifeform to [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Oriana\|Oriana]].

Just before the remotely controlled crash done by the [[Species and Civilsations/Startail Scientists\|Startail Scientists]], one of the few life-pods ejected from the vessel just before entering the [[Planetary Systems/Quilifen System\|Quilifen System]], a few hundred kilometers away from [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Untundria\|Untundria]].
