Deadman's Barrens is the largest desert in [[Locations on Planets/Scoranta\|Scoranta]], and on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Haloora\|Haloora]]. Home to the [[Plants and Animals/Rauwing\|Rauwing]], a flesh eating bat-like creature that swarm the desert is large groups, blocking out [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Ingi\|Ingi]] for minutes at a time.

This is where Aria lands after planetfall, causing a large crater in the dead center of the desert. After wandering the desert for a day, she is attacked by the Rauwing and almost killed, but being rescued by a native [[Species and Civilsations/Psynovates\|Psynovates]] who lives near the desert, who uses fire to blast the Rauwings back.
