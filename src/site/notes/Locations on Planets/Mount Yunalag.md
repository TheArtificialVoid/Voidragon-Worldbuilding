Mount Yunalag (orginally called Killer Peak) Was named after the first person who reached the summit, [[Unique People/Mrs Juna Yunalag\|Mrs Juna Yunalag]]. Home to many dangerous wildlife (as recorded by Mrs Yunalag), the fauna and flora on the mountain has killed many previous mountaineers whom tried to conquer the mountain.

After Mrs Yunalag conquered the mountain, several [[Species and Civilsations/Psynovate Scientists\|Psynovate Scientists]] were sent to the summit to both understand the wildlife, and to make technological discoveries about the mountain.
