Ametrice is the northern pole of [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Mantle\|Mantle]], and home to the [[Species and Civilsations/Thornarites\|Thornarites]]. Although extremely warm, the lands are hospitable and allow for Mantlian plant and fungi to thrive under the heat.

The area was named after one of its main exports, Ice Quartz, which is used for advanced machinery, and also some magical properties for people with [[Magic and Plans/Ice Magic\|Ice Magic]].
