The Broken Terraformer on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Rani\|Rani]] was one of four of the [[Structures and Cities/Ancient Terraformers\|Ancient Terraformers]] located on moons within the [[Planetary Systems/Quilifen System\|Quilifen System]]. Once as functional as the other terraformers on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Regolanith\|Regolanith]], nuclear tests from the [[Events/Xerk-xee Nuclear Tests\|Xerk-xee Nuclear Tests]] transformed the once great terraformer to rubble.

Although the Terraformer has completely collapsed, a strange growth, called [[Plants and Animals/Terminal Growth\|Terminal Growth]] has appeared around the rubble, bordering the [[Moon Locations/Glass Desert\|Glass Desert]].
