Canvas Cavern is a deep cave located between the [[Moon Locations/Dryandrian Forest\|Dryandrian Forest]] and the [[Moon Locations/Neorifolian Forest\|Neorifolian Forest]] on the equator of the moon.

The cave is made from moonrock, and plunges deep into the moon's surface. Glowing lichen called [[Plants and Animals/Canvas Lights\|Canvas Lights]] dominate the cavern's interior, lighting up the cave and making most of the cavern breathable. The name Canvas Cavern comes from the Canvas Lights' ability to leave colours upon physical interaction.

The main feature of the cave is the [[Dimensional Stuff/The Othergarden\|The Othergarden]] portal located deep within.
