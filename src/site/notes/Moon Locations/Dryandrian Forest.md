The Dryandrian Forest is found on the moon [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Regolanith\|Regolanith]], and is the most distant from the other forests, being on the darker side of the moon. Although mostly in the dark, the forest thrives while relying on one of the [[Structures and Cities/Ancient Terraformers\|Ancient Terraformers]].

The [[Moon Locations/Karri Lake\|Karri Lake]] and the [[Moon Locations/Solandri Lake\|Solandri Lake]] are found within the forest, with both lakes being the only ones on that side of the moon.
