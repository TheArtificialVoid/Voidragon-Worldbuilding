Deep space is the space between galaxies within the universe.

Not much is found here, although notably a single asteroid with a portal to [[Dimensional Stuff/The Othergarden\|The Othergarden]] was discovered far into Deep Space outside of the [[Universe Locations/Grandway Galaxy\|Grandway Galaxy]].
