(Void Vortexes) Voidtexes are splits in the fabric of spacetime, that ooze out [[Voidragon Stuff/Void Energy\|Void Energy]] into the universe. Although these splits are rare, these Voidtexes cause major environmental damage, burning forests and melting mountain sides, depending on how large the Voidtex is. Voidtexes can be found although out the [[Universe Locations/Grandway Galaxy\|Grandway Galaxy]], although small traces have been found throughout [[Universe Locations/Deep Space\|Deep Space]] and other nearby Galaxies.
