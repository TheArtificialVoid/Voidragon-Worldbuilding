The Voidragon are an almost extinct race of interdimensional travelers that had originally conquered the multiple dimensions, having the most technological advancement out of any known species.

(Mostly unknown -)
During some very dangerous experiments from trying to use and harvest [[Voidragon Stuff/Void Energy\|Void Energy]] from a mysteriously powerful (and unwilling) Voidragon test subject. Massive amounts of [[Voidragon Stuff/Void Energy\|Void Energy]] were released, shattering many of the connected home-worlds, and terminating the Voidragon species. Some non-Voidragon witnesses from the accident saw Aria herself becoming overwhelmed with the energy, causing her to wreak havoc on the civilization, directly playing into their collapse.

(Known by most -)
Due to some unknown reason, the Voidragon species civilization collapsed overnight, killing off most of the species and leaving their home-worlds destroyed. The only evidence of their existence are the ancient technology left throughout the galaxy, and the damage done to many other systems in the galaxy.

The before the collapse, the [[Species and Civilsations/Startails\|Startails]] knew of the Voidragon's existence, with few interacting on each other's homeworld in person. Before the Startails were able to commit fully to space travel however, [[Events/The Voidragon Collapse\|The Voidragon Collapse]] occurred, ceasing all communication between the two species.

The last remaining Voidragon is [[Unique People/Aria (The Last Voidragon)\|Aria (The Last Voidragon)]], the endling of her species.
