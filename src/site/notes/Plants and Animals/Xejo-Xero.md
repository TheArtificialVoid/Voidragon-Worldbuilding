Xejo-Xero is a large mold-like species that feeds off of the heat of the [[Structures and Cities/Ancient Thermal Plants\|Ancient Thermal Plants]]. Xejo-Xero is an invasive species that was spread to the Thermal Plants accidently by [[Species and Civilsations/Startail Scientists\|Startail Scientists]] from the planet [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Mucora\|Mucora]] of the [[Planetary Systems/Mykesian System\|Mykesian System]] during [[Events/Project Mucora\|Project Mucora]].

Xejo-Xero both feeds off of the heat of the thermal plants, and fixes them using sections of itself. It learned this feature after suffocating one of the previous thermal plants, causing it to collapse. Due to the radioactive state of the current thermal plant it resides, Xejo-Xero has developed into a state of sentience, allowing it to learn and repair areas of the thermal plants.

Xejo-Xero is currently in a state of reproducing, forcing large sections of itself underground, and growing throughout the cave systems throughout the interior of the planet. Many of these cave systems link to other Thermal Plants found throughout the planet, with seven, or possibly more already claimed by the mold.

Xejo-Xero and [[Species and Civilsations/The Protectors of the Machine\|The Protectors of the Machine]] are currently in a state of warfare, with The Protectors burning Xejo-Xero with constructed flamethrowers, and Xejo-Xero suffocating with their mold spores, collapsing caverns and sending [[Plants and Animals/Xejo Walkers\|Xejo Walkers]] to kill them.
