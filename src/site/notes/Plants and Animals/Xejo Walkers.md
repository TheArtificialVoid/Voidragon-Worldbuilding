Xejo Walkers are 2 legged, walking bundles of moss. Their movements are controlled by [[Plants and Animals/Xejo-Xero\|Xejo-Xero]], and are usually sent out to kill [[Species and Civilsations/The Protectors of the Machine\|The Protectors of the Machine]], or to scout out cave systems. They are silent creatures, but you can smell them from long distances due to how they are made of mold.

Although no features can be made out on their heads, they are able to see, and sense noises and vibrations around them. They are unable to speak, and gathered specimens if taken too far away from their point of capture, melt.

There have been legends of a sentient Xejo Walker, with large red eyes that wanders [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Untundria\|Untundria]]. Many locals of [[Locations on Planets/The Winterlands\|The Winterlands]] spot it wandering across vast distances, and communicating with not just the local population of [[Species and Civilsations/Untundrian Tribes\|Untundrian Tribes]], and [[Species and Civilsations/The Protectors of the Machine\|The Protectors of the Machine]], but the wildlife too. Although unconfirmed if it truly exists, [[Unique People/The Wanderer\|The Wanderer]] is a legend that has spread throughout [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Untundria\|Untundria]].
