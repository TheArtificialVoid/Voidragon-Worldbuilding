Although the original name for the The Six-Sided Flower is lost to time, some knowledge of the plant is still known by very few. The Six-Sided Flower is a extinct plant that used to be found throughout the home-worlds of the [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidragon\|Voidragon]]. This plant was used as both cultural significance for the Voidragons, and as a food source for many of the inhabitants on the Voidragon's Homeworlds. 

Aria has a necklace with the jewel on the front in the shape of the flower, with the last seed of the Six-Sided Flower within.
