Canvas Lights are a glowing species of lichen that live within the [[Moon Locations/Canvas Cavern\|Canvas Cavern]] on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Regolanith\|Regolanith]]. 

The Canvas Lights are known for their colour changing properties that occur with physical contact. Although only found within the [[Moon Locations/Canvas Cavern\|Canvas Cavern]], [[Species and Civilsations/Startails\|Startails]] harvest the lichen and allow them to grow within the cave systems on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Oriana\|Oriana]].
