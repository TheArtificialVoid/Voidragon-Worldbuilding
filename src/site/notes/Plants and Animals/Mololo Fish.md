Mololo fish are a fish-like species that live on the surface of the lava oceans of [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Mantle\|Mantle]]. Although the oceans of lava are extremely hot, and many are unable to swim in them, many lavafish like the Mololo have hardened, heat resistant scales, that allow them to thrive in the lava oceans.

Mololo are also extremely fleshy fish, and are frequently hunted by [[Species and Civilsations/Pyroxones\|Pyroxones]] and [[Species and Civilsations/Thornarites\|Thornarites]] alike as a very nutritional meal.
