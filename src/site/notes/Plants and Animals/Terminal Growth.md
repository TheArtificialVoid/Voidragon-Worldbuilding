Terminal Growth is a growth that began to spew from underneath the ruins of the [[Moon Locations/Broken Terraformer\|Broken Terraformer]]. This growth has formed its own micro-biome with many different animals, plants and other growths forming within and on it. The Terminal Growth borders the [[Moon Locations/Glass Desert\|Glass Desert]], and some of the growth has managed to bloom underneath the glass ground.
