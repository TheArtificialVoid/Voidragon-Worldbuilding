 The Blood Bulb is a Size 5 (on the [[Magic and Plans/Y.E.S.C.I.\|Y.E.S.C.I.]] Scale) cactus like plant organism that hosts a small colony of [[Plants and Animals/Rauwing\|Rauwing]]. Blood Bulbs florish in [[Locations on Planets/Deadman's Barrens\|Deadman's Barrens]] on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Haloora\|Haloora]], but some have been found within [[Dimensional Stuff/The Othergarden\|The Othergarden]].

The Rauwing and the Blood bulb have a symbiotic relationship, with the Rauwing going out and hunting, gathering flesh, blood and bone, and depositing it back at the blood bulb. The Blood bulb then transforms the tissue into nutrients, for both the Rauwing and the Blood bulb, allowing them both to feed and thrive.

The Blood bulbs are named after their blood and tissue absorbing/transforming properties, allowing them to transfer blood, skin, flesh, and bone into nutrients from within their roots.
