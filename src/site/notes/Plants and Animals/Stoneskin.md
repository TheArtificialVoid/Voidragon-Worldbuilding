Stoneskin are very large, wandering beasts that walk through the lava oceans of [[Planet Ocean Locations/Magnoian Ocean\|Magnoian Ocean]] and [[Planet Ocean Locations/Phreatol Ocean\|Phreatol Ocean]].

Size 9 on the [[Magic and Plans/Y.E.S.C.I.\|Y.E.S.C.I.]] Scale.
(Extrival Class).

They stride out deep into the lava oceans, yet often wander towards the poles to eat [[Keker Lillies\|Keker Lillies]] and any other plants founds near the oceans. They tend to sink within the lava oceans to wash themselves, or to keep themselves warm, also in turn feeding the  small barnacle like ecosystems on their backs.
