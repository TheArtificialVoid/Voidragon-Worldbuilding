Rauwing are dark brown bat-like creatures that live on the bulb of the [[Plants and Animals/Blood Bulb\|Blood Bulb]] found throughout the [[Locations on Planets/Deadman's Barrens\|Deadman's Barrens]]. They feed of any large enough animal that wanders into the desert, flocking from their Blood bulb stems to create large swarms in the sky, and then all swooping and taking a bite each per swoop. leaving nothing in its wake. 

Around a size 4 on the [[Magic and Plans/Y.E.S.C.I.\|Y.E.S.C.I.]] scale, their smaller size allows them to bundle together easier on the [[Plants and Animals/Blood Bulb\|Blood Bulb]].

The Rauwing and the Blood bulb have a symbiotic relationship, with the Rauwing going out and hunting, gathering flesh, blood and bone, and depositing it back at the blood bulb. The Blood bulb then transforms the tissue into nutrients, for both the Rauwing and the Blood bulb, allowing them both to feed and thrive.
