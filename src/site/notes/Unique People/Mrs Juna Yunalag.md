Mrs Juna Yunalag was a Teacher from the [[Species and Civilsations/Psynovates\|Psynovates]] species that climbed [[Locations on Planets/Mount Yunalag\|Mount Yunalag]] to prove that in times of desperation, you must forge a new future through overcoming great challenges. 

The mountain (Originally named Killer Peak) was a death trap for many mountaineers over the thousands of years of the mountain's existence, but after a major bounty was placed for reaching the summit, which rewarded the mountain with a major currency prize, and the mountain changing its name to the climber. 

Mrs Yunalag ran a class on the far side of the [[Locations on Planets/Martol\|Martol]] continent, within the town of [[Structures and Cities/Zevia\|Zevia]]. During one of her lessons, a few pupils were talking about losing hope and faith with their future on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Haloora\|Haloora]], after [[Events/The Voidragon Collapse\|The Voidragon Collapse]]. To raise spirits within her class, and her town, she vowed to climb the mountain, and reach the top, to prove that they will thrive without the [[Voidragon Stuff/Voidragon\|Voidragon]], and are able to forge their own future.

After starting the climb, she gathered world-wide attention after her message, and her written diary entries portraying the difficult climb. Undiscovered flora and fauna species throughout the mountain gave her quite the difficulty climbing to the top, forcing Mrs Yunalag to stay for several months climbing the mountain. When she reached the top, she swear she saw "A strange man" near the top of the mountain, this spooked her enough to consider climbing down the mountain, but she still forged forward. 

After reaching the top, she took several photos of the peak, and the view, and after leaving a [[Locations on Planets/Martol\|Martol]] flag at the top, she left, and fled down the mountain. After reaching the base of the mountain after almost two years of climbing, she was celebrated as a national hero, and was immortalized through the renaming of the mountain.
