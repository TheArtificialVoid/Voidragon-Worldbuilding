Eltlin the Warrior is an old, wise warrior from [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Untundria\|Untundria]], through the [[Species and Civilsations/The Protectors of the Machine\|The Protectors of the Machine]]. Once an well-known and respected leader, he fled from [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Untundria\|Untundria]] after world-wide backlash from being too powerful for his people. He landed on [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Regolanith\|Regolanith]] and now made his life mission to fix the [[Structures and Cities/Ancient Terraformers\|Ancient Terraformers]] that populate the surface.

He currently resides in the [[Structures and Cities/Dryaterraformer\|Dryaterraformer]], taking out his frustration on any living creature that enters the facility.
