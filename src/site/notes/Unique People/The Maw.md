The Maw is a large serpentine-like organism that lives within the blistering heat of [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Ingi\|Ingi]].

Although currently in a deep sleep, it periodically wakes up every few 100 years to ravage the surface of the star to eat and to protect its home either through destroying nearby starships, or sending large portions of plasma at anything nearby.

Although normally hostile, records from [[Moons, Planets and Stars/Oriana\|Oriana]] share that a bond between The Maw and one individual from the [[Species and Civilsations/Startails\|Startails]] species. although this [[Unique People/Starlit-legend\|Starlit-legend]] was mostly considered a folklore tale from the [[Species and Civilsations/Startails\|Startails]].
